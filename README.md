# jquerycdn: the easy to remember jquery cdn.
Please note that all of these are minified versions of jquery

### Main CDN (does a 301 redirect to javascript file):

[jqry.tk](https://jqry.tk)

### Ending in .js CDN (Main redirects to this)

[jqry.tk/j.js](https://jqry.tk/j.js)

(See bottom for alternative names)

### No 301 redirect CDN (so no auto redirect, works both https:// and http://)

[n.jqry.tk](http://n.jqry.tk)

### 301 Redirect to Google jquery CDN

[g.jqry.tk](https://g.jqry.tk)

### 301 Redirect to Google jquery CDN ending in .js

You can use any string of characters, for example [g.jqry.tk/hahathislinkisreallylong.js](https://g.jqry.tk/hahathislinkisreallylong.js) = [g.jqry.tk/j.js](https://g.jqry.tk/j.js)

Please note that subdomains are not automatically redirected to https while non-subdomains are.

### Alternatives to /j.js
